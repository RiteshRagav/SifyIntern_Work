    "planning_rules": "Create a structured product demonstration that follows the AIDA framework (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action).

Each scene should highlight a single feature or benefit.",
    "camera_rules": "Use close-up shots for UI details and feature highlights. Medium shots for context and user interaction. Wide establishing shots sparingly. Smooth transitions between features. Screen recordings should use subtle zoom effects to guide viewer attention. Maintain consistent framing throughout.",
    "tone_guidelines": "Professional yet approachable. Confident but not arrogant. Focus on user benefits rather than technical specifications. Use active voice and action-oriented language. Maintain enthusiasm without being salesy. Clear and concise narration.",
